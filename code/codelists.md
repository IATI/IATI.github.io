One common operation required to make semantic use of IATI data is the transformation of machine-readable codes into human-readable names. Below are some examples of how to make these transformations. These examples assume you're already familiar with the IATI Datastore API; if not, please see the documentation on the IATI API Gateway: [https://developer.iatistandard.org/](https://developer.iatistandard.org/). 

## Python
```python
print("hello world")
```

## Javascript
```javascript
console.log("hello world")
```

## R
```r
message("hello world")
```
